 * @brief Initializes the the driver

 * be called only when the checksum is correct. Packets with incorrect checksum
 * will be omitted and the fuction will not be called for those packets.
 * This function should be as fast as possible, since it is called in the
 * interrupt routing and other interrupts proccessing are hold, while this
 * function is being executed. A slow function could cause data lost in your
 * MPX driver. The function receives two parameters: size - the size of the
 * received packet; buf - a pointer to the buffer, that contains the received
 * packet. Callback function should copy the buffer's content for further
 * processing. After the callback function returns the buffer can be used by the
 * driver for receiving the next packet. You may set this parameter to NULL if
 * you do not need to receive any packets.

 * the packet with a greater priority will be transmitted and the packet with a
 * lower priority will be delayed. If both of those packets has the same
 * priority, then the packet with a greater size will be transmitted. If
 * priorities and sizes are the same, then the packet with higher destination
 * address will be transmited, etc.
 * @param address - destination device address.
 * @param data - a pointer to the buffer, that contains data to be sent. The
 * first byte of the buffer must contain message-id and the other bytes
 * must contain message data. You should not matter about the checksum, since
 * the driver will calculate it automatically and will insert it into the packet.
 * @param size - the number of bytes (2...12) to be sent from the data buffer.
 * @param callback - a function to be called, when the packet will be
 * transmitted. The parameter could be set to NULL or ommited, if you don't need
 * it. This function should be as fast as possible, since it is called in the
 * interrupt routing and other interrupts proccessing are hold while this
 * function is being executed. A slow function could cause data lost in your
 * MPX driver. The function receives the only parameter, that indicates the
